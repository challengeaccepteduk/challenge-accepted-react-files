              ticking off loads of our own challenges and tracking them in many
              different ways from a scratch map for travel, a list on our phones
              for books to read that year, a squat challenge app, an app to
              track football stadiums visited, marks across our online maps for
              restaurants we wanted to visit, together attempting to claim all 7
              mountains around Bergen, Norway, and many more. We, like many
              people we know, have a million and one personal challenges we are
              trying to complete and had no one place to keep track of them all
              which means we are unlikely to finish them all and even forget
              about how many weâ€™ve actually started.
              <br/><br/>
              Our new challenge became creating an app to help us track and
              therefore ultimately complete our many challenges.

            Steph, given her background in brand and marketing across large
            tech companies and a start up app, took on the role of scoping the
            app design, defining the brand and business plan. Along the way
            having to pick up some new learnings from financials, legal and
            brushing up photoshop skills. Paul, who has a background of
            programming at large tech, gaming, fitness and telco companies,
            developed the app from scratch and has managed all the product
            testing. This required picking up some additional programming
            languages along the way.<br/><br/>

              Alpha testing started Feb 2020. From March, Steph is working full
              time on the app and business plan, and with lockdown in place Paul
              is working around the clock in his spare time working on the
              amends from alpha testing and final features added ready for Beta
              testing in April 2020. Once we've completed our testing and fix
              stage, we'll be ready to launch on Android and Apple store in June
              2020.
